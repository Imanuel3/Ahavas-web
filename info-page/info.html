            <p class="textOfBerth">Ahava Meshikhi was born in <a id="mosk" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow" target="_blank"> Moscow Russia </a> on the date of 1963 November 18th, she was raised by her grandfather (Chaim) and grandmother (unknown).
                Her and her family moved to <a id="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" target="_blank">Israel </a>when she was 10 years old and she stayed there until her military service was up, when she was a full grown woman she moved to <a id="NY-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" target="_blank">New York City </a> to teach Hebrew at a Orthodox Jewish school.
                There she found the church called <a id="TS-link" href="https://tsc.nyc/" target="_blank"> Times Square Church </a> and became a Christian, this was a big transformation for her because she was born into the Jewish faith and followed it her whole life up to this point.
                After this she had a yearning in her heart to go back to <a id="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" target="_blank">Israel </a> and to preach to her own people. when she was in <a id="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" target="_blank">Israel </a> she met her husband at a Bible study whose name was Yaakov, after this point Ahava and Yakov went across Israel to try to preach the word of God and to bring people salvation.</p>
